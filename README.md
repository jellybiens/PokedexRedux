Pokedex made with React Redux

Code found in /dev/ folder

Search through the pokedex and view different pokemon information.

Encounter pokemon and catch them with the encounter button on list view,
and evolve pokemon you have caught in the pokemon information view


ISSUES

Dragscroll library doesnt work on mobile with the pokemon information when the description goes overflow of the containing div.

 

TODO

Create web service that hosts the pokemon images for the app to call for, reducing reliance on external 3rd party sites hosting the images.
Then create a procedure that downloads and updates the images with the latest available when new games come out and their sprites are made available online.

Add sounds and event music.

Improve pokemon data accuracy and add more pokemon from later game generations, including branching evolutions and temporary mega evolutions.
